    "Now its time to learn how to make a function. A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data to functions, these are known as parameters. A function can also return data after it runs but we wonâ€™t worry about that for now. In Python, a function is defined using the def keyword. An example of the cell below is an example of a basic function press run and see what happens"
